Dotted by grand and majestic forests, sedate and tranquil lakes, expansive and voluminous orchards, and vivid and fragrant gardens, Parwanoo is adorned with some beautiful natural features. The rolling hills of Trikuta form a sprawling backdrop to the town and give it a pleasant atmosphere at all times. Parwanoo is marked by tall temperate coniferous forests. The undulating structure of the mountains appears pleasing, with the blue Shivaliks fading away in a mystic aura with the sky and the lush green slope in the forefront. Trekking across the naturally made trails is an energetic and explorative adventure. It is also dotted with various temples visited by many pilgrims throughout the year, some quite offbeat compared to the grandiose.

### Trikuta Hills
**Location**: Sirmaur district, Himachal Pradesh

The Trikuta hills at the foot of the Shivaliks are significant especially due to its similarities with the Trikuta hills in Katra, Kashmir. Known for its 3 peaks, the hills bear sacred to the goddess Durga and thus the Kali Mata Temple 2 km from Parwanoo becomes indicative of its solemnity. The hills are cut smoothly into steps for farming giving it a pleasant view from far and also enabling the prevention of soil erosion. Home to orchards and gardens, these plantations provide fresh fruits like apples, oranges, bananas, pears throughout the year.   

**Good to know**: One of the best ways to indulge in the scenic vastness of these hills is to take a cable car ride across the peaks.

Various small agro-based industries in Parwanoo are set up for the production and processing of fruits, thus forming the largest processing unit in the state.

The gardens provide a perfect spot for picnics with children since they can pluck the fruits directly from the trees.

One would quite forget about social media or cell phones in such a place.
