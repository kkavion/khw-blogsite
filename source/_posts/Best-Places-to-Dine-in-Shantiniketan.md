Known for its rustic flavours, Santiniketan has in store a variety of eateries in an around the campus of Vishwa Bharati. Besides, restaurants offering food at reasonable rates line the nooks and corners of the town.  Beer and wine shops are sparsely located but a drink that is worth trying is the rice beer which has the perfect rural Bengali touch to it and is a huge hit amongst tourists during the fair. It's much lighter than normal beer but is brewed in the region and not easy to find elsewhere.
