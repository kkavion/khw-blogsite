### Grand Bazaar
**Location**: JN Street, MG Road Area, Puducherry, 605001
**Open**: 
**Pocket Pinch**: 

Pondicherry’s Grand Bazaar is the typical Indian market that doesn’t rest until all its items are sold out or until the footfall dries up to a mere trickle. The early mornings and the hot insipid afternoons deter neither the vendors nor the customers. Both the sections, agog over commerce and trade ward off all evil and indolence. The market is divided into various sections as any other Indian market is. The fish, the meat, the vegetables, the spices and the flowers are segregated for good measure- anything else will clutter this grand bazaar further than what is already is. Stop here to behold a Pondy you’ll hardly find anywhere else.   

**Must Buy**: Fish, meat, vegetables, spices & flowers

### Pondi Sunday Market
**Location**: Mahatma Gandhi Rd, Chinnakadai, MG Road Area, Puducherry, 605001
**Open**: 
**Pocket Pinch**: 

The Pondy Sunday Market is a weekly bazaar with all the essentials one might need. It is a cross between a convenience store and a flea market that jerks into life every Sunday 10 am onwards. Stores selling books, electronics, and clothes dapple the expanse of this bazaar. Busy haranguing and bargaining characterise this cityscape. One might doubt the quality of the products on offer because they are available (sometimes) at dirt-cheap prices. The Pondy Sunday market might not be as great as Goa’s weekly bazaars but it is nonetheless a good spot to visit especially if flea markets interest you.   

**Must Buy**: Books, electronics & clothes
