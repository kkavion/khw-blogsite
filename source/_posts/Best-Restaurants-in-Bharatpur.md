India has become synonymous with the most flavourful food in the world, with tastes that dance across your tongue leaving you with memories closely associated with the place! Due to its proximity to the Brij area, the cuisine in Bharatpur is a mixture of local Rajasthani and even Moghlai styles. Be it vegetarian, or non-vegetarian, every traveller is utterly spoiled for choices. Pickles and Indian sweets like imarti, moong dal halwa and malpua are famous across sweet shops in the city. Among others, the Rajasthani Thali with many delicious dishes in a single plate will awe every food enthusiast.

### Local Delights
When you think of local food, the Rajasthani Thali, a delightful array of several mouth-watering and colourful dishes come to mind! But you cannot skip on the other, equally famous dishes indigenous to the city! The dal kachori, aloo sabzi and the velvety rabri are certainly sold out in all the stalls and dhabas. Like most North Indian states, you will find long queues in the dhabas because of their perfectly authentic taste of gharana or home-style cooking! Do not hesitate from popping into a roadside dhaba for a little snack en route your travels, but you might end up staying for a full course meal!

Although the restaurant serves a variety of cuisines, the Tandoor dishes like Chicken Tikka, Paneer Tikka, and Afghani Chicken are crowd favourites and always in high demand. The Mango Souffle on their menu is a must-try as it has gained statewide repute- it is a lovely Indian twist on a well-known western dessert as the chef adds fresh juicy mango slices to the fruit-based custard! The restaurant will ensure that your waistlines are well padded by the time you leave!
