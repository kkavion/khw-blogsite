Bengal is famous for its mouthwatering food in popular cuisines. Digha is one shining example of the party that awaits your tastebuds. The most delicious seafood fresh from the water, with balanced spices and stunning colours create the best aroma wafting through their restaurants. The street food offers lip-smacking delights like jhaal muri or chaat near the sea while the restaurants serve flavourful delicacies, especially the Elgin Restaurant, Bay Cuffe Restaurant and the Azad Hind Dhaba.

### Local Delights

Digha serves some of the best seafood and fish delicacies of local Bengali cuisine, which is why missing out on the Pomfret, Rohu, Bhetki, Fried Fish, and Tiger Prawn is a crime! Preparations like grilled pomfret, batter-fried bhetki or bhetki finger fries, and Rohu fish curry are a few must-eats. Grilled pomfret is all about the freshness of the fish, with the skin charred and the flesh moist and tender with light seasoning and a squeeze of lemon, while batter-fried bhetki is the Bengali version of fish and chips but with a generous amount of spices, which is served with mustard sauce. The Rohu fish curry has the fish fried with salt and turmeric and then added to a gravy enriched in spices with a base of tomato and onions. A plate of rice to accompany these delectable dishes is all you need to fall in love with the food, the view, the serenity, and Digha itself!   

**Must Savour**: Grilled Pomfret, Batter-fried Bhetki, Rohu fish curry
