Indore's street food is one for the books. A delightful blend of flavours and textures, it offers a unique gastronomic experience that attracts food lovers from all over. From the iconic Poha Jalebi to savoury snacks like Bhutte ka Kees and Khopra Patties, each dish tells a story of local traditions and ingredients. With a focus on freshness and bold flavours, Indore's street food is not just a meal; it's a celebration of culture and community that every visitor must savour.

### Poha Jalebi
**Where**: 
**Pocket Pinch**:

It is a unique breakfast combo and the most popular combination here in Indore, but don’t be surprised to find the dishes being served separately in other parts of India, as it is quite common to relish the two dishes separately. In Indore, people usually prefer to eat with a combination of sweet and salty dishes. The flattened rice, Poha, is made with various veggies, nuts, spices, and curry leaves. The dish is then thoroughly mixed and garnished with the likes of lemon, sev, and coriander. Jalebi, as a street food dish, lacks nothing, starting from being crispy to being sweet. The most astounding thing that compels almost everyone to have it is its sweet, savoury sugar syrup. In Indore, the Poha and Jalebi are eaten together, allowing you to enjoy the spicy and tangy Poha along with the sweet and crispy Jalebi. The two dishes complement each other beautifully.

### Khopra Patties
**Where**:
**Pocket Pinch**:

A step up from the regular Aloo Patty, Khopra Patties is a traditional dish and one of the most popular in the streets. The Khopra in Khopra Patties refers to dried and grated coconut mixed with spices, nuts, raisins, coriander leaves, and salt to taste; it almost loses its essence without ginger. The coconut blend, which is deep-fried in hot oil until it turns brown, is placed inside hollow potato tikkis. Khopra Patties is not just a treat for the mouth but for the nose and eyes as well, as it has a refreshing fragrance and looks delicious. The tangy tamarind toppings and the green chutney, along with the crunchy coating of the patties, just add to the wow factor of the dish.

### Shahi Shikanji

This famous drink in Indore will make you forget the best smoothies, drinks, and milkshakes once you taste it at Sarafa Bazaar.

The Shahi Shikanji is a proper meal in itself; it is an independent drink. It is best served cold, and you can elevate your experience by topping it with malai.
