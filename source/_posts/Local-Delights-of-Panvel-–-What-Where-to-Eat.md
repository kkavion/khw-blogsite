Maharashtra food, while sharing its similarities to other parts of the country, has wheat, jowar, lentils, vegetables, and peanuts as part of their daily platter. In the Konkan region, rice is a staple, and coconut is used heavily. Typical Marathi foods like Poha, Pav Bhaji, Vada Pav, Puran Poli, Modak and Misal Pav are available popularly in Panvel. South Konkan's Malvani cuisine is predominantly non-vegetarian with an influence of Mughlai, and Chinese as well.

### Chats and Pav Bhaji
In Panvel, you must try Papri Chat, Gogappa, Bhel Puri Dahi Vada, pav Bhaji and more street delicacies. Chatoree at Orion Mall is probably the best place to try them out. The dishes can be customized to your preference of spicy, sour or sweet to allow the flavours to burst in your mouth. Cholee Bhatoree is a must-order item here.

With an outer layer made with rice flour and Maida, the inner filling consists of grated coconuts and jaggery giving it the perfect balance of flavour along with texture.
