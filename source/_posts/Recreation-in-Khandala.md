It is cheap, accessible and safe. The meandering lanes, overhanging clouds, towering trees and ethereal lakes constitute a natural haven. Nature enthusiasts from different parts of the state frequent this spot especially in monsoon to witness the wanton waterfalls.

Scenic trails create an enthralling ambience where you can exert and exhaust yourself. With the hills, the lakes- and everything else at your disposal, Khandala by itself is an amusement. Set forth and soak in the vibe.

### Hiking

The Bhaja Caves are located at an elevation of 400 m from the foot of the Bhaja village. This altitude, though not intimidating, might seem imposing to many novice hikers due to the uncompromising rugged roads. The Karla caves are also an excellent destination for hiking. The rustic paths are a source of endless pleasure and the mise-en-scene is absolutely benumbing to all pain you might encounter along the trail.   

**Good to know**: The two caves are only a 14-minute drive away from each other but you can also trek all the way within one and a half hours.
