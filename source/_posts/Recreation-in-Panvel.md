Panvel is ideal for engaging in some adventurous treks and sports. The hills and forts having been explored thoroughly over the last few centuries provide a clear and detailed route to the summit. While some treks require experienced travellers due to their precarious steeps, others are perfect for beginners as well. Treks like the Prabalmachi Fireflies Night Trek, Irshalgad Trek, Manikgad Fort Trek, Karnala Fort Trek and the one to Kalavantin Durg are wonderful journeys to undertake to see the sprawling landscape spread under the vast sky.

### Prabalmachi Fireflies Night Trek 
It is ideally a two-day event where one climbs the Fort on the first day from 7:30 pm to reach at night. After resting, the night walk commences where one sees in the depth of wilderness small fireflies glowing among the trees and grasses. Itâ€™s a beautiful experience to have a natural light bulb sit lightly on your fingertips. Such joy and such profound happiness can probably never be experienced elsewhere.  

**Good to Know**: This trek begins from the remote village at the base of the Prabalgad Fort.

### Irshalgad Trek
The trek begins from Nanivali, near Chowk town, which lies on the Kajrat-Panvel highway. From here on, it is a 2.3 km walk up to the Irshalwadi village and it is only so far that the children are allowed, till the pinnacle base. The walk can prove to be a great time for you to discover the love of adventure in your family.

**Good to Know**: The trek has three levels. It is advisable to end the trek at the second level to avoid risks.
