In the Sundarbans, you can try a very different kind of safari than what you are used to setting out on a boat for river safaris! The riverine transport adds an extra thrill to the experience of questing after elusive creatures of the wild. In the Sundarbans, all you need is a little luck and patience! It would be no great surprise to see the amber and obsidian hide of a Royal Bengal tiger swimming alongside your cruise boat, or find the beady eyes of a crocodile somewhere on a muddy coast. The boat safaris are equipped also for all types and duration of travel so you may have your pick.

### Boat Safari
The boat safari is the oldest service offered by the government here and requires you to sacrifice a little sleep for a good cause! The early hours of the day, under the golden sunshine and warm breeze are considered the best for bird watching. Keep your fingers crossed and cameras ready as you may even chance upon the graceful and sleek gaits of tigers roaming in the forest.

**Good to know**: Privately run boat rentals are available daily with government-mandated permits like forest entry fees and video camera fees.

### Cruise Safari
You will be most comfortable relying on cruise safaris that are essentially group tours so you get the experience of a hotel on the waters and the merry company of fellow tourists. Travelling by cruise can take you to the famous points of Sudhanyakhali, Sajnekhali, Jhinga Kali, and Dobanki watchtowers. Forget the hassle of traveling as you can even choose cruises online according to your preferences.

**Good to know**: SunderbanChalo, VivadaSunderban, Sundarbans Jungle Camp, and Tour de Sunderban offer private cruise tours where you have the luxury of tailoring your journey to your taste!

### Burirdabri Watch Tower
**Location**:

Although considerably distanced from Sajnekhali and other popular watch towers, the Burirdabri Watch Tower is one which sees fewer tourists but offers a splendid view of the reptiles below and a graceful vision of the Raimongal river which forms the international boundary between India and Bangladesh. The wooden bridge, mud walk, mangrove cage and the watchtower all make it a must visit site.

### Bonnie Camp Watch Tower

50 feet high, the watch tower at Bonnie Camp is the tallest in Sundarbans and offers the most stunning view of the jungle with creeks flowing by and the creatures of nature roaming about in its premise. They also have cottages where overnight stay is possible. The occasional growling of tigers, barking of deer or the eerie presence of another makes the experience exhilarating.

### Jhingekhali Watch Tower
**Location**:

The Jhingekhali watch tower allows a scenic view of the jungle with a smaller number of people hovering about. Situated on the eastern part of the Bashirhat Range, the forest is better preserved because it sees fewer visitors due to its distance from Sajnekhali. This also increases the chances of sighting tigers here.

**Good to know**: The watch tower is often visited in accompaniment to the Burirdabri watch tower and can hold twenty people at a time.
