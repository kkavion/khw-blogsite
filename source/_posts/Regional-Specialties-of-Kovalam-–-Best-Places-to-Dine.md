The cuisine in Kovalam is simple, light and traditional. The delicious array of culinary delicacies exhibits the fundamental of South Indian culture with a distinct inclination towards rice-based dishes. Cereals, spices, curry leaves and coconut flavours are the hallmarks of South Indian cuisine and have popularised the food trends in Kovalam. As a seaside community, the locals depend on fresh and organic seafood to enrich their diets and a lot of attention is paid while preparing mouth-watering vegetarian dishes. Your taste buds are in for a treat while you stay in Kovalam and you can treat yourself to their healthy and wholesome meals without any guilt.

### Local Delights
The local cuisine in Kovalam is incomplete without puttu and kappa, which are everyday staples for the locals and exotic delicacies for visitors. Even if you find your tongue tripping over their rustic names, you will be mesmerised enough once you have tried them! Puttu is a common breakfast dish that combines rice with grated coconut and is served with chewy red bananas. Kappa is for those who favour spices as the herb mix is a common accompaniment to most non-vegetarian curry dishes made at home. You will be spoilt for choices when it comes to seafood- from juicy crabs and lobsters to delicate shrimps, squids and fresh fishes, there is nothing off bounds in Kovalam!
