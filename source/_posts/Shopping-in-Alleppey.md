It is impossible to leave Alleppey without shopping for decorative pieces, souvenirs and most importantly, items made of coir. The local markets are always brimming with colourful handicrafts, traditional handmade jewellery and beautiful textiles, especially sarees. Alleppey being a small city does not have a huge choice of shopping malls. The two reliable shopping malls are the Reliance Mall and the Neveeta Shopping Mall. Kabeer Plaza is also a popular shopping complex among the locals. Apart from the malls, the Flea markets offer a wide range of products from stationery items to spices. Basic necessities such as rice and wheat are available at subsidized prices. Such markets sell freshly made spices and completely authentic products.

- #### Destination Speciality
With local small-scale coir industries forming a big part of Alleppey’s economy, the coir handicraft items are really unique to this town. Khadi items and spices are also famous items which the town offers. Food items and snacks like banana chips and cashew nuts are also typical to the state of Kerala and are of the best quality here.

- #### Local Souvenir & Artefacts
Souvenirs, especially ones made of coir are found in shops around the streets of Alleppey and are frequently bought by the visitors. Intricately designed coir items such as carpets, wall hangings, and rugs are worthy of being taken home as souvenirs and keepsakes.
