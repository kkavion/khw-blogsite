Sariska is essentially a natural destination and the availability of shops and markets is negligible to none. However, it is quite close to Alwar and Jaipur, cities booming with heritage and culture. The local markets are vivid, colourful places with lots of items to purchase as souvenirs. They have great stuff for go-to street fashions along with accessories and chunris in their native Rajasthan designs. If you are looking for home decoration, the markets are an ideal place to purchase pottery and showpieces. Since Rajasthani art is a whole different genre in itself, one can find some beautiful pieces to purchase and take back home.

### Kagzi Pottery
Artistry unique in its kind, kaagzi pottery is and its technique originated in medieval India. The pots are fine as paper, often sold without any colour, however other kinds are also available. Pots are designed in the technique of scarfito where intricate designs are incised into the well-made pot. Sometimes patterns of arabesques are also used while the rest is painted with different colours and designs. When they are sold, they look beautiful together and at home, they can give a chique elegant delicacy to oneâ€™s living room or other interior spaces.
