The backwaters of the Sundarbans are well known for seafood due to the abundance of water around.  Fish, prawns, and even crabs are freshly caught from the waters of the bay and are resplendently presented in a variety of delicious recipes. The mouth-watering Hilsa fish with its tantalizing aroma and the special prawn preparation called Chingri Malaikari which is buttery soft and packed to the brim with flavor are smashing hits in the Sundarbans. Stalls on the mainland also have handcrafted local sweets that celebrate honey- another local produce skillfully obtained by the locals.
