The Kanha National Park is not a mere handful of fascinations rather each place, activity and dish will let you add a new experience in your treasured memory lane. Let your itinerary not be banal, make it one that you would look forward to experience over and again. When even a whit of fun is cherished and exhilarates our day to the zenith, the superfluous thrill and amusement amidst the teeming verdure and wildlife of the renowned Kanha National Park will rejuvenate all your senses and dissipate all your blues from the urban soul. 

### 1. Must Visit
The first thought that comes to mind while mentioning Bamni Dadar is the sight of a spectacular sunrise. This list of the must-visit places will remain incomplete without the mention of such a captivating spot which has been bestowed with great value and beauty since the British era. Other than the enchanting spot of its own, the Kanha National Park has another place at a distance of few km with the same thrill and amusement that you cannot miss out. Crammed with varied flora and fauna, the Bandhavgarh National Park is an ideal place to hear the roars of the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger.

### 2. Must Do
Safaris top the list of musts for a trip to any national park. The Kanha National Park allows three forms of safari and each comes with fun and thrill as they allow you to get to the pith of the park and relish the nature and the animals in their natural habitat. Other than safari, what you must also indulge in is getting information about the national park that you are visiting. Information is not always about pages that are crammed with mundane facts and a trip without knowing much about the place can make it incomplete. The Kanha Museum is quite enlightening about its wildlife treasure. So, the information and displays of the museum can’t be missed.

**What**: Safaris, Browse through Kanha Museum <br>

### 3. Must Eat
Relish the authentic cuisine of Madhya Pradesh, the central Indian state. If you wish to try the local cuisine, there are myriads of dishes that you can fill your platter with. The local cuisine of Kanha National Park in itself is a treasure trove of dishes with the perfect harmony of a plethora of flavours just like the vibrant flavourful cuisine of India. Once you are here, you must try Bhutte Ki Kees, Rogan Josh, Dal Bafla, Poha and special Lassi.

### 5. Must Experience
So far we have known about the thrill of safari in the broad daylight but other than that you must also experience the night safari in the Khatia buffer zone, which allows the visitors to get a mesmeric nocturnal sight of the teeming wildlife. Like adventurous safaris, nature trails also allow us to explore the wilderness on foot. That was all about adventurous experiences but whether we are at our home or a trip, we always look for serenity and there’s no place like Bamni Dadar in the Kanha National Park that can exude more tranquillity. Experience the charm of beguiling nature with the rising sun and the scintillating shafts glinting up the entirety with golden hues.
