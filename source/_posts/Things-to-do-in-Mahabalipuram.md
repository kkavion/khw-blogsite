Divorcing the cares and worries of a regular life, you’ve come to an ancient town. The boulders, the overhanging greenery and the beach let you retire from a life fraught with mundane regularity. On this trip, you want to indulge; you want to let lose. You want to experience those things that your unseeing eyes would not have taken to. This list helps you realise those dreams and desires. As you dally in and around the town with all the blues cast behind you, indulge in everything Mahabalipuram has to offer. Eat a traditional Tamil meal. Visit the beaches and monuments. Collect memorabilia from the beach markets and go back home a lot more rejuvenated.

### Must Visit
Mahabalipuram’s identity is intertwined with the group of monuments recognised by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. While you’re in this historic town, skimping on these delights is simply egregious. The splendour of the 6th and 7th century Pallava architecture hasn’t degraded with time. It still holds it grandeur that impresses one and all that comes by. These quaint structures that include cave and, rock-hewn temples are the precipitation of utmost artistic dexterity and affluence. The mighty Arjuna’s Penance to the humbler Atiranachanda, every monument in this assemblage is striking and stunning. When in Mahabalipuram you have to visit these sites, you have to soak in their divinity.

### Must Do
While in Mahabalipuram, make use of all its water-bodies. The seas give you the opportunity to indulge in several water-sports. Surf in the waters or enjoy a placid boat ride. Camp at the beach with your family, friends or partner. Buy souvenirs from the markets to remember you trip to this ancient town. Collect seashells or watch the fishermen as they play the disciples to the Bay of Bengal. Go on a fishing tour and learn the trade or craft. Pick up some trade secrets; get a better understanding of what fishing is actually like. Marvel at the clear waters, the ethereal seas and the mellow-soft sand.

**Where**: Mahabalipuram Beach

### Must Eat
You have to relish a typical Tamil meal. This includes more than the stereotypical idli, dosa and vada. Try out their seafood, the various curries, and the many rice dishes like the pongal. Cherish the rasam as it travels down your throat. Lick clean the bowls of all the chutneys served to you. Savour the sweet, delicious payasam as the hearty goodness of milk and rice placates your full and expanded tummies. The lingering taste of all the spices and the wanton aroma of everything on your plate will satiate. And when you have to recount your Mahabalipuram days, do not discount all the amazing food that you’ve eaten. Pick up only those items that truly speak to you.

**Where**: Gecko Café, Rose Garden, Le Yogi, Fisherman’s Nautilus, Wharf at Blu Resort, Water’s Edge Café, Blue Elephant, Freshly ‘n Hot 

### Must Buy
Don’t get lost in the frenzy of shopping. If the Pallava architecture has rendered you absolutely speechless, buy the tiny replicas that you will find along the routes that lead to the monuments. When in the Indian Seashell Museum, you’re dumb-stricken, pick up one of the many products from Maya Bazaar. It could be pearl jewellery or the items crafted out of the pretty conch-shells. Stand stupefied but buy something to materialise your stupor. Take them back home. Turn them into home décor. Or, gift them to someone you love or to someone you know will treasure your memories just as much as you do.

### Must Experience
The Mahabalipuram Dance Festival is a culmination of all things artistic and aesthetic. The graceful performers all engaged in their artforms deliver an evening that you will forever remember. Adorned in their costumes and strengthened by the love and adulation of the audience, the dancers appear as the reincarnate of Lord Shiva themselves. Their perfect postures, the perfect ambience of pleasant winter and the stunning backdrop of Arjuna’s Penance create a mahol you cannot miss. Compelling and moving, this festival is attended by renowned performers. This is a celebration you have to partake in. This is an event you don’t want to miss.
