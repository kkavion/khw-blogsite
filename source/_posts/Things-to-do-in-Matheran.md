### Trekking
As automobiles have been banned inside the small town of Matheran, the only methods of transport are pony rides, rickshaws and on foot. Most places can be reached on foot so trekking through the trails and up the hill slopes to visit the viewpoints is a common activity here. The trail from Dasturi to Matheran is a popular hiking trail, especially in monsoons when visitors can witness waterfalls on either side of the road.

**Good to Know**: Another popular hiking trail is the Garbert Plateau.
