Kanyakumari, where the land meets the sea, boasts a a delightful fusion of flavours, featuring staple ingredients like rice, coconut, and a variety of spices. From the comforting Thengai Sadam to the refreshing Sarbath, each dish tells a story of tradition and taste. Whether enjoyed at bustling street stalls or renowned restaurants, Kanyakumari's food is a must-try for any visitor seeking an authentic experience.

### Parotta
**Where**: Kanyakumari - Thattukadais or street shops in Nagercoil
**Pocket Pinch**: ₹ 90

Parotta is a staple yet special dish, not just because it is common in these places, but because of the curry it is served with alongside. The common gravy served in Kerala and Tamil Nadu is Chalna. Chalna itself is similar to the one served in other districts until they add pandan leaves to the gravy. Chicken Perattu is the curry alongside Parotta, perfect for those looking for something zesty. The standout feature of this curry is that, unlike many common curries, the gravy does not enhance flavors from the ever-used onion and tomato; instead, they slowly cook the chicken and use coconut and a few spices.

### Sarbath
**Where**: Kanyakumari - Thiruvananthapuram to Nagercoil Highway
**Pocket Pinch**: ₹ 150

More than being special, Sarbath is very beneficial, especially during the summer, as it helps cool the body and regulate body temperature. Sarbath is the drink that people with constipation should look out for because it purifies the blood and gradually provides relief from constipation. It also helps in preventing rheumatoid arthritis and gout due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The reason behind its medicinal properties is that it contains nannari, or as some call it, sarasaparilla. The Sarbath is prepared by boiling the root with sugar to form a syrup.

The dish Avial originates from the states of Tamil Nadu. Unlike other stews, this one is very thick and heavy, giving you a beautiful experience of tasting a perfect mix of 13 different vegetables. The vegetables used in the stew are those commonly found in the Western Ghats. Avial is an essential part of their main meal and is at its best when only crunchy and crisp vegetables are used. Vegetables like elephant foot yam, plantain, ash melon, carrots, beans, brinjal, cucumber, drumstick pods, snake gourd, and broad bean are included. Avial is also believed to have been invented by the warrior Bheem during his exile.

### Sadhya
**Where**: Kanyakumari - The Curry
**Pocket Pinch**: ₹ 300

The Sadhya is best served for lunch, but when served for dinner, a lighter version of the original dish is appropriate. The preparation can be a little strenuous as it starts the night before, with dishes prepared before ten o'clock in the morning on the day of the celebration. As generations have passed, Sadhya is now served on tables, as people no longer find it convenient to sit on the floor. Before the preparation of the Sadhya, there is a careful initiative to ensure quality, starting with a devotional prayer to Agni, the God of Fire, followed by lighting the fire. It is a tradition that the first serving is offered on a banana leaf in front of a lighted nilavilakku as an offering to God.
