Cuisine at Nagarhole is mostly the Kodava, the origin of which traces back to Coorg. Major dishes of this local cuisine contain rice as a component, making the dishes sumptuous. The flavor is rare, authentic, and is tongue-tickling. Food is an essential part of any trip and plays a major role in determining how satisfying it was at the end of the day. A hungry dissatisfied stomach will naturally be very displeased no matter how beautiful a spot turns out to be. But with Kodava delicacies like Akki Roti, Ragi Mudde, Uppittu, and Vangi Bath to add that extra zing to your tastebuds, Nagarhole becomes a trip far away from something even remotely disappointing. Traditional sweets Mysuru Pak, Obbattu, and Dharwad Peda are just sufficient to calm the sweet tooth down.

### Akki Rotti
This is a deliciously flavoured rice-bread which serves as a perfect breakfast item for one and all. The well kneaded dough seasoned with a choice of local oriental spices and vegetables contributes to the dish being a favourite among the tourists travelling around here. This bread is usually a large one, since the dough is spread evenly on the griddle to cover it entirely. A dash of butter enhances the meal altogether.

### Mysuru Pak
A dense rendezvous of ghee, gram flour, sugar, and cardamom, Mysuru Pal is a sweet that is bound to leave you craving for more. With a buttery mixture often resulting into a hard cookie, Mysuru Pak is a tradition-compulsory sweet dish offered in weddings and other auspicious occasions. Birthed in the kitchen of a food connoisseur, paak, or sticky sugar syrup is the ingredient that enhances its taste by ounces immeasurable.
