Puducherry is a tureen of different flavours and food. It is home to Creole cuisine- a juxtaposition of Tamil and French cooking. The proliferation of cafes and restaurants by people of different nationalities has endowed Pondy with cuisines from all over the world. Freshly baked baguettes, croissants and ratatouille along with Masala Dosas, rasam and payasam are all that you need to let your taste buds delight in every single bite. Eating at one of Puducherry’s restaurants forces a question to mind: what has been borrowed and what is intrinsic? The answer is none. It is not unusual see a road-side food vendor dishing out plates of curd rice or a Tamil chef bent over a pizza oven. Whether it is rasam or ratatouille, there is no dearth of options when it comes to Puducherry’s food and dining.  

### Local delights
**Where**: Baker Street, Chez Pushpa, The Botanist Lounge, Villa Helena, Kooraikadai Restaurant
**Cuisine**: Indo-French
**Open**: 
**Pocket Pinch**: ₹ 400 onwards per person

Pondy’s culinary extravaganza is an orchestra of French conventions and typical South Indian flair. Honouring its superfluity of coconuts and seafood, a number of curries have evolved over the years combining the French and south-Indian flavours. Kadugu Yerra is perhaps the best exemplar combining the staples of mustard, and curry leaves with vinegar. Idli, dosa, uttapam, and rice are staples. French delights like crepes, baguettes, and croissants dominate the platter equally. The most popular dessert is paal payasam (rice-milk pudding). Traditionally all meals were eaten on banana leaves. You can still find some restaurants following this custom even today.      

**Must Savour**: Kadugu Yerra, Idli, Dosa, Uttapam, Crêpe, Baguettes, Croissants & Paal Payasam
