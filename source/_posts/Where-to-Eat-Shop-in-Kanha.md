Sunlight peeping in through the lofty sal trees, grasslands and meadows crammed with limpid water bodies, Kanha exudes the vibe of the rich and vibrant African veldt. Although the Kanha National Park being a protected reserve area has lots in stock as natural fascinations, the eateries here are limited in options. You can experience the luxury dining of multi-cuisine as well as local food in the resorts and hotels. Apart from dining options, since Kanha National Park is a wildlife reserve, the area and won’t offer you hordes of shops but you can always visit the local market to bring back souvenirs for yourself or as gifts.

The Kanha National Park does not have local cuisine of its own but fret not as you will get to relish the varieties of dishes of the central Indian state, Madhya Pradesh, which adorns the platter with food replete with flavours and an authentic touch. Include Korma, Dal Bafla, Bhutte ki Kees, Kebabs, Poha, Rogan Josh in your meals along with desserts like Jalebi, Ladoos and delectable beverages such as Lassi or Sugarcane Juice.
