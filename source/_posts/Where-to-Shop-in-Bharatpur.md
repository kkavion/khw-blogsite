To collect souvenirs for your loved ones you may limit your shopping sprees to the local markets and souvenir hubs that primarily deal in local, handcrafted goods which reflect the cheerful, artistic and refined interests of the local populace. The plethora of colours, use of semi-precious stones and cut glass are trademarks of Rajasthani craft. For shopaholic tourists, you may resort to the shopping mall for some familiar urban comfort.

### Destination Speciality
Items for home decor, Rajasthani clothing, and jewellery are very popular in Bharatpur. You will find rows of shops selling antiquated Kundan jewellery embedded with stones and cut with traditional patterns. The crisp heaviness of the bandhej material will give you a feeling of imperial quality and you can take this cloth home to design clothes in your own style! The best souvenirs are small showpieces, usually made of pristine marble or stately brass that will add a touch of regal glamour to your home instantly!

### 1. Mathura Gate
**Location**:<br>
**Open**: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm<br>
**Pocket Pinch**: ₹ 750 for two

Mathura Gate is a popular market among tourists due to the fair prices offered by the sellers. The place is distinguished by the fanciful archaic gate built across the road, below which extend the street shops buzzing with the hubbub of mercantile activity. Take your time to truly see the many types of jewellery, shoes and little decorative items on sale. Even haggling amicably over prices may give you a sense of entertainment with the friendly shopkeepers- lively and voluble, many will guide you to the best-selling items and make your shopping experience that much more enjoyable!

### 2. Chaurburja Bazaar
**Location**:<br>
**Open**: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm | 6:00 pm - 11:00 pm<br>
**Pocket Pinch**: ₹ 350 for two

You will need some special time set aside for a visit to Chaurburja Bazaar which has many shops housed under one antiquated fort-like roof. Due to the close confines, the shops are usually crowded and long queues are par for the course. But the shops will be well worth the wait since they store the most authentic articles of Jaipuri clothing like nagrai shoes and brass jewellery. Carvings of soothingly cold, smooth marble are available in various sizes as well as eye-catching lamps and gorgeous wall hangings- all in one place. The old-style awning provides much-needed shelter during the scorching summers and lends an air of nostalgic rusticity to the market!

### 3. Shopping mall (First Mall built)
**Location**: Achnera Road Bharatpur, Rajasthan 321001<br>
**Open**: 11:00 am - 03:00 pm | 6:00 pm - 11:00 pm<br>

For the locals, malls might be almost unnecessary considering the exciting range of local markets and numerous shops peppered all around the city. Rather than being cooped up in one place, tourists and locals may prefer to branch out for their shopping sprees so that they can see and experience indigenous specialties. Moreover, unwieldy glass and metallic contraptions would surely detract from the natural beauty and old-world charm of this desert city! However, in response to quick urbanisation, the frequent inflow of tourists and an increasing metropolitan culture, the First Shopping mall was built on Achnera Road, near the famous Bah Resort. If you are quite tired from your day’s travels or need a quick last-minute bout of shopping without much looking around, the mall houses some familiar clothing and dining brands to help you out!
